				It was suggested to me that writing is a good way to deal with grief. I wanted to do something more than write. I'm not a great writer anyway, and I feel Lacee deserves to be memorialized in a lasting way. I decided to build a website in her honor. I want the world to know how
				special she was, and how much she meant to me. I want to share her story, and I want to share my story. I want to share our story. I want anyone who stumbles upon this site to know that Lacee was here, and she was loved.

		<div><p>I don't plan on really publicising this site just yet, so if you were led here by someone, or stumbled upon it, feel lucky. It may be a virtual blessing, but you are now blessed to have known the most wonderful dog I have ever met.</p></div>
